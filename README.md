# To do:
1. I don't like the name PermitWatch entity. Want to change it to TrackedEntryPoint.

## Getting Started

1. If not already done, [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2.10+)
2. Run `docker compose build --pull --no-cache` to build fresh images
3. Run `docker compose up --wait` to set up and start a fresh Symfony project
4. Open `https://localhost` in your favorite web browser and [accept the auto-generated TLS certificate](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15076602/1352334)
5. Run `docker compose down --remove-orphans` to stop the Docker containers.
6.
